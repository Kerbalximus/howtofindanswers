			<p>These kinds of questions you <s>can</s> should <b>google</b> first!</p>
			<p><b>To google</b> means:
				<ol>
					<li>Open 
							<a target = "_blank" href = "https://google.com">Google</a>
						or other search engine - for example <a target = "_blank" href = "https://yandex.com">Yandex</a> 
					</li>
					<li>Enter your request.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p> But what's wrong with asking such questions in chat rooms/forums?</p>
			<p>Almost all of your questions are recently or have been searched for a long time. This means that you will find it in Google and won't disturb other people in chat rooms/forums </p>
			<p> So asking questions in chat rooms / forums is forbidden/unethical/bad?</p>
			<p>Not really. If you have a question, first Google it, then if you can't find the answer, you can ask your question in forum.</p>
